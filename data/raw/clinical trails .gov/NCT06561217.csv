NCT06561217,Assessing the Performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Augmented Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data Abstraction for Clinical Trial Patient Screening,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06561217,,COMPLETED,"Identifying eligible patients is a key process in the clinical trial enterprise. Currently, this process relies on time-intensive manual chart review, creating a rate-limiting step for trial participation. The integration of AI technology into the trial screening process has potential to improve participation rates. This study aims to assess the performance (accuracy, efficiency) of AI-augmented patient identification and inform optimal integration into clinical research screening processes.",YES,Cancer,OTHER: Chart review,"Abstracted Chart-level Accuracy, The primary outcome measured was mean chart-level accuracy, defined as the percentage of elements identified by clinical research coordinators among all elements in the gold-standard set, measured for each chart, and averaged across all charts. Research coordinator-abstracted responses were identified as being accurate when they exactly matched with the gold-standard set. The gold-standard set was determined by 2-3 clinicians blinded to experimental arms., 1 year","Efficiency of Chart-level Abstraction (in Minutes), Efficiency was calculated as the number of minutes spent on each chart abstraction., 1 year",,University of Pennsylvania,Mendel AI,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,355,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,854016,2023-08-18,2024-07-12,2024-07-12,2024-08-19,2025-07-25,2025-07-25,"Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, 30307, United States|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT06561217/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
